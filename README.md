# So_Long

Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window 
management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! 
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to 
open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: 
being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, 
do some information research, and so forth

You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin
escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of
a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any
character, any collectible and any place you want.
